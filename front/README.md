# Sentitube Frontend

This directory contains a small Next.js application used as a placeholder UI. It was created for Next.js **15.3.3** with TypeScript.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The default route now displays a simple landing page with a search bar and a call
to action. Mocked sentiment analysis results remain available at `/results`.
